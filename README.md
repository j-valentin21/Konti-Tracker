# Konti-Tracker
Keeps track of all information related to your PTO and points for all employees who do not have a tracking system provided by their employer.

## General info
Points(points are accumulated when unscheduled time is taken. The maximum amount of points allowed was 15 points for each employee.Once this amount was reached
the employee would be terminated from their employment.)

This web app was created to allow all employees without a tracking system in there place of employment to keep track of all there PTO/points in one central location.During my employment, I had to keep track of all this data manually, and whenever I was interested in retrieving this information I had to make a request 
to my supervisor or manager for a printout of this data.
